Sphinx Startup
==============

First run::

        $ sphinx-quickstart

There will be questions to ask about your setup. Press enter to questions for the default setting.

With the ``sphinx-quickstart`` script, it creates a ``Makefile`` and a ``make.bat`` file.
To execute: ::

	$ make html

This will build the HTML docs in the build directory you chose. In the ``/html/`` folder there will be an *index.html*.
